        Virat Kohli is a prominent Indian cricketer known for his exceptional batting skills, particularly in limited-overs formats, and his aggressive captaincy style.
        Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, he has become one of the most successful and celebrated cricketers globally. Kohli is renowned for his fitness, technique, and ability to chase down targets, setting numerous records in both ODIs and T20Is.

        He began playing cricket at a young age and joined the West Delhi Cricket Academy at nine. He captained India's victorious Under-19 World Cup team in 2008.

    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        Virat Kohli is a 12th grade pass; he completed his schooling but did not pursue higher education. He studied at Vishal Bharti Public School and Savior Convent School in Delhi. He left formal education after completing class 12 to focus on his burgeoning cricket career, particularly after being selected for the India Under-19 team. 
    </li>
    <li>
        From a young age, he showed a strong interest in cricket, often picking up a bat instead of books. Recognizing his talent, his family enrolled him in the West Delhi Cricket Academy when he was just nine years old. As his cricketing schedule became more demanding, he later shifted to Saviour Convent School in Paschim Vihar to balance both studies and sports. Although academics took a backseat due to his intense focus on cricket, Kohli was known to be sharp and disciplined in school. His teachers and coaches remember him as a bright student who managed to stay attentive despite dedicating most of his time to training. While he did not pursue higher education due to his early entry into professional cricket, his journey reflects how dedication and passion can shape one‚Äôs path beyond traditional academics.

<h2 id="why-virat-number-18?">Why Virat number 18?</h2>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        Kohli's association with the number 18 began during his under-19 days, but it gained profound significance after the untimely demise of his father on December 18, 2006. At just 18 years old, Kohli shouldered the weight of personal tragedy and emerged stronger, channeling his grief into his cricketing ambitions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Kohli didn't choose 18. It choose him‚Äîfirst as a random Under-19 jersey, then as a destiny-charged symbol wrapped in triumph and tragedy.
